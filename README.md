EPICS motor support for simulated motors

[![Build Status](https://github.com/epics-motor/motorMotorSim/actions/workflows/ci-scripts-build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/epics-motor/motorMotorSim/actions/workflows/ci-scripts-build.yml)

motorMotorSim is a submodule of [motor](https://github.com/epics-modules/motor).  When motorMotorSim is built in the ``motor/modules`` directory, no manual configuration is needed.

motorMotorSim can also be built outside of motor by copying its ``EXAMPLE_RELEASE.local`` file to ``RELEASE.local`` and defining the paths to ``MOTOR`` and itself.

motorMotorSim contains an example IOC that is built if ``CONFIG_SITE.local`` sets ``BUILD_IOCS = YES``.  The example IOC can be built outside of the driver module.
